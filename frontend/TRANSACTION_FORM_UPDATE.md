# Transaction Form Update Summary

## âœ… What Was Added

### 1. **New Form Fields**

- **Transaction Date**: Date picker with ISO 8601 format output
- **Amount**: Number input with validation for positive values
- **Transaction Type**: Dropdown with enum values from database schema
  - DEPOSIT
  - WITHDRAWL
  - LOAN
  - PAYBACK
- **Loan Type**: Conditional dropdown (shows only when Transaction Type = LOAN)
  - LIVESTOCK
  - INDIVIDUAL
  - LAAGODI
- **Fund Type**: Conditional dropdown (shows only when Loan Type = LAAGODI)
  - DDS_FUNDS
  - PROJECT_FUNDS
- **Comments**: Optional text field

### 2. **Form Validation**

- **Required Fields**: Mandal, Village, Customer, Transaction Date, Amount, Transaction Type
- **Conditional Required**:
  - Loan Type is required when Transaction Type = LOAN
  - Fund Type is required when Loan Type = LAAGODI
- **Amount Validation**: Must be positive number
- **Date Validation**: Must be a valid date

### 3. **Smart Form Behavior**

- **Cascading Dropdowns**: Mandal â†’ Village â†’ Customer
- **Conditional Fields**:
  - Loan Type field appears only for LOAN transactions
  - Fund Type field appears only for LAAGODI loans
- **Auto-Reset Logic**:
  - Changing mandal resets village and customer
  - Changing village resets customer
  - Changing transaction type resets loan/fund types
  - Changing loan type resets fund type

### 4. **Data Processing**

- **Date Conversion**: Form date is converted to ISO 8601 string format
- **Amount Conversion**: String input converted to integer for API
- **Type Safety**: All enum values are properly typed

### 5. **UI Improvements**

- **Better Layout**: Grid layout for better organization
- **Section Headers**: Clear sections for Location and Transaction Details
- **Loading States**: All dropdowns show loading indicators
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages and validation
- **Descriptive Labels**: Clear descriptions for each field

## ðŸŽ¯ Form Schema Structure

```typescript
{
  mandal: string (required),
  village: string (required),
  customer: string (required),
  transactionDate: Date (required),
  amount: string (required, positive number),
  transactionType: "DEPOSIT" | "WITHDRAWL" | "LOAN" | "PAYBACK" (required),
  loanType?: "LIVESTOCK" | "INDIVIDUAL" | "LAAGODI" (required if type=LOAN),
  fundType?: "DDS_FUNDS" | "PROJECT_FUNDS" (required if loanType=LAAGODI),
  comments?: string (optional)
}
```

## ðŸ“¤ API Output Format

When submitted, the form sends data in this format:

```json
{
  "mandal": "mandal-1",
  "village": "village-1",
  "customer": "customer-1",
  "transactionDate": "2024-01-20T10:30:00.000Z",
  "amount": 5000,
  "transactionType": "LOAN",
  "loanType": "LIVESTOCK",
  "fundType": null,
  "comments": "Loan for buying cattle"
}
```

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps

To complete the transaction system, you would need to:

1. **Create Transaction API Endpoint**: `POST /api/transactions`
2. **Add Supervisor Selection**: Get current user or add supervisor dropdown
3. **Database Integration**: Connect to actual PostgreSQL database
4. **Success Handling**: Redirect to transaction list or show success state
5. **Edit/View Transactions**: Additional pages for managing existing transactions

The form is now fully functional with proper TypeScript types, validation, and matches the database schema requirements.
